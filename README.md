# SiO2 - Quartz

quartz comes in many varieties, colors, crystalline structures. So do your apps! This is an adaptation of the popular `vitesse` starter-kit that leverages many state of the art plugins and advancements in the vue ecosystem.

## Purpose

The objective of this starter kit is to integrate further advances in design system thinking and modern css along with some automations to kick off new designs in a hurry while not sacrificing integrity. 

Unocss (and utility engines/frameworks) is great, but using them alone incurrs certain amount of technical debt.

Follow Andy Bell and others to learn about intrinsic design that scales to all platforms. This is hard to do with utilities alone and requires some more intentional approaches. 

These approaches, such as CUBE methodology, are baked into this kit. 

## Definitions

CUBE is applied by integrating the composition into pre-defined `.vue`. sfc's and blocks map nicely to components.
